# DayPlanner

HW 05

In this assignment we were instructed to create a scheduler for any particular workday. The current date must show above the schedule.

The schedule goes by business hours 9am-5pm and the javascript must highlight the hours by past, present, future.

The sceduler must save input to local storage, I tested with live server constantly to check if the input saved. If I wanted to delete the input I would just delete the information held inside, save again, and refresh the page.

I got everything to work I believe however since I didn't do this before the given business hours I didn't get to test if the hours were highlighted but I believe the code is right.
